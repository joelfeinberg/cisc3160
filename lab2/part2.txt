Problem 1:
I used Python.
I chose it because I haven't worked with csv files before, and all the resources I found used Python.
I also chose it because Python is a language I'm currently learning and I wanted the practice.
The pandas library made it a pretty simple task.
I don't think I would use a different language for this problem.

Problem 2:
I used Python.
I chose it because I'm currently learning Python and I wanted the practice.
Since Python is still new for me it took me a bit longer, but as  language it worked fine for the problem.
It might have been interesting to try it with a functional language, like Scheme or Lisp.

Problem 3:
I used bash.
I chose it because based on my understanding of what the problem was asking, it's the simplest language to use.
I didn't have difficulty with what I did, but I had difficulty understanding what the problem was asking and whether I did what the problem required.
I'm not sure if I would use a different language because I'm not sure if I understood the problem.
